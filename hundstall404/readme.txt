We love dogs. This plugin shows a random homeless dog on your 404. Why waste the space?

When installed, this WordPress plugin will override your themeâ€™s 404 page and instead display a random homeless dog + links back to Hundstallet and to your homepage.

Since Hundstallet is a Swedish organization, all copy is in Swedish.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zipped file to yoursite/wp-content/plugins
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
